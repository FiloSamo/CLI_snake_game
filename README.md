# CLI_snake_game 🐍🎮
Small snake game running in the command prompt or powershell in windows.

I designed this software during my first year of my bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering. It's a snake game that runs in the Windows command line.
It allows players to pass throught walls and to reappear on the opposite side of the map.

Unfortunatelly when i designed the software I did it in italian, so the majority of the code is not commented in english.
What I don’t like about this executable is that each character cell in the command line is taller than it is wide, making the map appear square when, in reality, it isn’t.
